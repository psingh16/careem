2. General Description
 2.1. Product Perspective
The shipment delivery is B2B platform that can work with commerce companies who need a shipment delivery service. The platform is a B2B one where commerce companies will request quotations for their shipments and the platform will look into its transportation resources to find the most cost-effective and reliable way to deliver shipments. The platform will be provided some inputs on different hubs and transportation resources from that for the last mile delivery. For inter-city shipment delivery, the platform can work with partners to deliver the shipments through trains, flights and trucks if required. The partner information will also be part of the input to the platform and is expected to change. This product has following features :

•	Cost effectiveness in making deliveries
•	Reliable delivery with ETA information for customers
•	Working with a variety of partner services for both inter and intra-city shipments
•	Reliable transportation shipment modes (e.g. is a bike the best way to transport a Fridge?!)
•	Ability to adapt to changing partner costs, as well as adding or deleting old or new partners as and when they come in or leave the system
